RGB players


different parts of the colorscheme, player can divide themself into the R G and B
Mazes.

Red  - Fire, can burn stuff, is destroyed on water contact, can fight better

G - Plants, can talk to animals, grow plants faster with the help of water

B - Water, can swim, should not burn, can make water to ice, walk on water


FIRE + WATER = STONE
Stone is rigid, like a shield.
Stone can divide itself back to water and lava by entering fire or rain.


Water and Plant form a rapidly growing biomass, that Lava can burn down to seperate them.

Plant and Lava shouldn't touch, otherwise Plant will burn and has to be extinguished by Water - but not too much, otherwise they will create an unstoppable forest.
Timing could be important.



CORE MECHANIC:
Three players, that form to one.
The Player, has three attributes, R, G and B. These Attibutes can leave the others others behind..
Three Status bars, each one for an element. Can charge it and deplete it by.

IDEA FOR PROTOTYPE 1:Simple player sprite, can change colors and spawn flames, water and plants.
